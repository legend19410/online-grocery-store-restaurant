One of two options:
1. Create a new mysql user and ensure password type is set to 'mysql_native_password'
    Run commands below to achieve this:<br/>
    1. CREATE USER '<newuser>'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED with mysql_native_password BY '<password>';
    2. GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON \*.\* TO '<newuser>'@'localhost';<br/>
                              or<br/>
       GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <database_name>.* TO '<newuser>'@'localhost';
    3. Flush Privileges;
2. Change the password type of 'root' to 'mysql_native_password'
   Run commands below:<br/>
   1. ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED with mysql_native_password BY '<MyNewPass>';
   2. Flush Privileges;

## note venv would need to be activated each time terminal is started
